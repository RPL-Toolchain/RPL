# RPL

This is the main source code repository of RPL. It contains the toolchain and documentation of RPL.

## What is RPL?

RPL is a Rust linter which decouples the definition of rules from the detection logic.
In particular, RPL consists of two primary components:

- a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) that allows developers to model/define code patterns,
- a detection engine to detect instances of these patterns.

The toolchain of RPL, which is a custom configuration of Rust compiler, enables accurate identification of code instances that demonstrate semantic equivalence to existing patterns.

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository and enter the directory: `git clone https://github.com/RPL-Toolchain/RPL.git && cd RPL`

2. Install RPL as a cargo subcommand: `cargo install --path .`

3. Run RPL analysis on your Rust project:

   - `RPL_PATS=/path/to/RPL/docs/patterns-pest cargo +nightly-2025-02-14 rpl` (using built-in RPL pattern definitions based on inline MIR)
   - `RUSTFLAGS="-Zinline-mir=false" RPL_PATS=/path/to/RPL/docs/patterns-pest cargo +nightly-2025-02-14 rpl` (using built-in RPL pattern definitions based on MIR) or `RPL_PATS=/path/to/RPL/docs/patterns-pest cargo +nightly-2025-02-14 rpl -- -Zinline-mir=false`
