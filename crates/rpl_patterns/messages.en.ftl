    .help = Consider using `Vec::truncate` instead

rpl_patterns_trust_exact_size_iterator = it is unsound to trust return value of `std::iter::ExactSizeIterator::len` and pass it to an unsafe function like `std::vec::Vec::set_len`, which may leak uninitialized memory

    .note = `std::iter::ExactSizeIterator::len` may not be implemented correctly, and it should be used as a hint rather than a fact
    .len_label = `std::iter::ExactSizeIterator::len` used here
    .help = incorrect implementation of `std::iter::ExactSizeIterator::len` must not cause safety issues, and consider using `std::iter::TrustedLen` instead if it's stabilized

    .help = use `std::cell::RefCell` instead

rpl_patterns_drop_uninit_value = Possibly dropping an uninitialized value
    .drop_label = dropped here
    .help = assigning to a dereferenced pointer will cause previous value to be dropped, and try using `ptr::write` instead

rpl_patterns_deref_null_pointer = Dereference of a possibly null pointer
    .ptr_label = pointer created here
    .deref_label = dereference here
    .note = this is because the pointer may be null

rpl_patterns_deref_unchecked_ptr_offset = it is unsound to dereference a pointer that is offset using an unchecked integer
    .reference_label = dereferenced here
    .ptr_label = pointer created here

    .cass_iter_next_label = `cass_iterator_next` called here
    .note = `cass_iterator_next` will invalidate the current item when called
